# Swift Concurrency Explained

Welcome to **Swift Concurrency Explained**, an open-source educational repository designed to help you master Swift's modern concurrency model.  
This repository serves as the practical companion to the guided course, providing hands-on examples, interactive tutorials, and exercises that explore concepts like `async/await`, `Task`, `TaskGroup`, `actors`, and much more.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to make **Swift concurrency approachable, practical, and fun**.  
Each module and code sample is carefully designed to build intuition and confidence while working with concurrent tasks in Swift.

In this repository you will find:

- Step-by-step tutorials to follow along with the course.  
- Example projects demonstrating real-world concurrency use cases.  
- Interactive challenges to reinforce your understanding.  
- Explanations and best practices aligned with Apple’s official documentation.

Whether you are new to Swift concurrency or looking to deepen your understanding, this repository is meant to guide you through the concepts in a structured way.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

Some of the core topics you can expect to find here:

- The evolution from completion handlers to structured concurrency.
- async  and  await  in Swift.
- Task ,  TaskGroup , and task cancellation.
- Main actor and working safely with UI.
- actors , data isolation, and preventing data races.
- Async sequences and streams.
- Best practices, patterns, and common pitfalls.

As the course grows, new modules and examples will be added to reflect real-world needs and advanced use cases.
